I was born and brought up from a town named Jagtial of Telangana state in INDIA. Basically I belong to a middle class family and learned good ethics and values from my parents. Situations from my life made me strong and accept any kind of challenges. I am bit practical too! I love to take responsibilities and good in initiating things to make it perfect. I have done my under-graduation from Jyothishmathi institute of technology and science from Karimnagar (INDIA) majoring computer science engineering in the year 2015. Since then I have worked for IBM India Pvt. Ltd till Dec, 2K19 as an SAP ABAP Consultant. My hobbies include singing, playing badminton. My favorite hobby could be sleeping!! :-p
